In this homework project I am utilizing the Angular JS framework where I am creating
a table for a shop owner, where all items the owner has in inventory along with the
pricing, the quantity of the items, the color of the items, a discount is applied
if an item has one and I have applied the given tax (0.0575%) are listed.

Additionally I will be using bootstrap and sass to style the table and apply all
physical changes.

To start you would need to set up your git repository and create your HTML. Apply
your script tags and link tags to you HTML.
